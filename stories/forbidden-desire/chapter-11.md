# Die Suche nach der Wahrheit üîç

*Handlungsbogen: Elenas Welt*

"Du hast WAS getan?" 

Maya starrte Elena an, als h√§tte sie ihr gerade erz√§hlt, dass sie plane, auf den Mond zu ziehen. Sie sa√üen in Elena's Wohnzimmer um elf Uhr abends, eine Flasche Wein zwischen ihnen und Mayas Laptop auf dem Couchtisch.

"Ich habe mit Alexander geredet. Er ist innocent, Maya. Ich bin sicher."

"Du warst auch sicher bei James."

"Das ist nicht fair."

"Es ist completely fair." Maya schenkte sich mehr Wein ein. "Elena, du kennst diesen Mann seit einer Woche. Eine Woche! Und jetzt planst du, eine Agentur mit ihm zu starten?"

"Nicht sofort. Wir planen nur‚Äî"

"Ihr plant NICHTS. Er plan, und du l√§sst dich mitrei√üen, weil er gorgeous ist und dich an possibilities glauben l√§sst."

Elena f√ºhlte einen flash von irritation. "Es ist nicht wegen seines Aussehens."

"Nein?"

"Nein. Es ist, weil er intelligent ist. Weil er meine Arbeit respektiert. Weil er things sieht, die ich nicht see, und er macht mich want, mehr zu sein."

Maya seufzte und lehnte sich zur√ºck. "Elena, ich love dich. Du bist meine beste Freundin, und ich will nur, dass du happy bist. Aber I'm scared dass du rushing into etwas bist, without thinking es through."

"Vielleicht habe ich zu viel thought durch die years. Vielleicht ist es time, zu trust meinem instinct."

"Dein instinct hat dich zu James gef√ºhrt."

"Nein," sagte Elena firmly. "Mein fear f√ºhrte mich zu James. Mein desire f√ºr safety und predictability. Alexander ist das opposite von safe."

Maya studied Elena's face. "Du magst ihn really."

"Ja."

"Wie much?"

Elena pausierte. "Genug, um scared zu sein. Genug, um zu want, dass es works out."

"Und wenn es doesn't?"

"Dann werde ich survive, wie ich es after James getan habe. Aber Maya, was wenn es does work out? Was wenn ich pass die chance von something amazing, weil ich too scared bin?"

Maya was quiet f√ºr einen moment. Dann opened sie ihren Laptop. "Okay. Wenn wir doing this sind, dann let's do it right."

"Was meinst du?"

"Research. Background checks. Due diligence." Maya's fingers flew √ºber die keyboard. "Wenn Alexander Stone ist wer er says er ist, dann let's prove es. Und wenn er's not..."

"Dann finden wir es heraus," finished Elena.

Sie spent die next zwei hours digging through public records, LinkedIn profiles, news articles, anything sie could find about Alexander, Stone Industries, und die Harrison situation.

"Look at this," sagte Maya, pointing to ihrem screen. "Alexander Stone left Stone Industries sechs months ago. Official reason was 'pursuing entrepreneurial opportunities.'"

"Was ist der unofficial reason?"

Maya clicked to another article. "According to diesem piece in Forbes, there were 'creative differences' zwischen Alexander und seinem father √ºber company direction."

Elena read √ºber Maya's shoulder. Der article mentioned dass Alexander had been pushing f√ºr more innovative approaches, while Richard Stone preferred traditional strategies. Es had been an ongoing conflict f√ºr years.

"Das supports his story," sagte Elena.

"Okay, aber look at this." Maya pulled up another article. "Stone Industries has been trying to expand in digital marketing f√ºr years. They've been looking f√ºr opportunities to break into der advertising space."

"So maybe Alexander leaving was strategic. Maybe er's supposed to start an agency als eine front f√ºr Stone Industries."

"Or maybe not." Maya clicked to a gossip column. "Look at der social pages from last month."

Es was ein photo from a charity gala. Richard und Patricia Stone, dressed formally, standing with various New York society types. In der background, visible but not prominent, was Alexander. Er looked uncomfortable.

"He's there, aber he's not center stage," observed Maya. "Das's not usual f√ºr a Stone family event."

Elena studied der photo. Alexander's body language was tense, distant. Er looked like someone who didn't want to be there.

"Keep looking," sagte Elena.

Maya found another article, this one from der business section of der New York Times. "Here. 'Stone Industries Under Fire for Environmental Violations.' Das was published vier months ago."

Elena read der article. Stone Industries had been accused of cutting corners on environmental regulations in one of their construction projects. Richard Stone had denied any wrongdoing, but environmental groups had protested au√üerhalb their offices.

"Look at der quotes," said Maya. "Richard Stone says, 'Stone Industries has always maintained die highest standards.' But look at this‚Äîthere's a quote from 'a source close to der family' saying dass internal audits had revealed problems months earlier."

"Du think Alexander was der source?"

"Maybe. Es would explain why er left‚Äîmaybe er couldn't be part of something er thought was unethical."

Elena felt a wave of relief. If Alexander had left Stone Industries because of ethical concerns, it suggested er was exactly wer er claimed to be.

But Maya wasn't done. "Look at this, though."

Sie pulled up a real estate record. Alexander's new TriBeCa loft. Der purchase price was $2.3 million.

"Holy shit," whispered Elena.

"Cash purchase," added Maya. "No mortgage."

Elena stared at der screen. "Er said er was living on his Sterling salary."

"Maybe er is. But er bought this place mit family money. Has to be."

Elena felt confused. "So was bedeutet das?"

"Es means er's still connected to Stone money, auch wenn er's not working f√ºr die company. Es means er could afford to take risks, to start an agency, to fail, because er has a safety net."

"Das doesn't make him evil, Maya."

"No, aber es makes his situation very different from yours. Du would be risking everything. Er would be risking... what, exactly?"

Elena thought about es. Maya was right. If their agency failed, Elena would lose her career, her savings, her future. Alexander would lose... was? Some pride? Er'd still have his trust fund, his family connections, his backup plan.

"Ich need to talk to him," said Elena.

"Elena‚Äî"

"No, Maya. Ich need to know if er's been honest mit mir. About everything."

Maya closed der laptop. "Und if er hasn't been?"

Elena thought about der afternoon im caf√©, about der way Alexander had looked when er explained about Harrison Industries. About der trust sie'd felt building between them.

"Then ich'll know dass I really am bad at judging people," said Elena. "Und ich'll stop trusting my instincts completely."

"Or," said Maya gently, "you'll realize dass you're getting better at seeing people clearly. That you're asking der right questions now, instead of just believing what you want to believe."

Elena nodded. Maya was right. A year ago, sie would have taken Alexander's explanation at face value, would have ignored any inconsistencies because sie wanted to believe er was perfect.

Now, sie was asking hard questions. Demanding truth. Protecting herself.

Maybe das was progress.

"Will you come mit mir?" asked Elena. "When ich talk to him?"

"Du want backup?"

"Ich want someone who loves mich und won't let me be stupid."

Maya smiled. "In that case, absolutely."

Elena's phone buzzed with a text von Alexander: *Thinking about our plans. Excited f√ºr tomorrow. Sleep well, partner.*

Elena stared at der message. Partner. Der word that had made her so happy this afternoon now felt loaded mit questions.

Tomorrow, sie would get answers. One way oder another.
